Subscriptions will renew automatically at the end of each billing cycle unless you choose to cancel. Please note that certain conditions may apply during the cancellation process. Lifetime subscriptions cannot be canceled.
</p>
<p>
  To buy content via Google Play, you’ll need an active Google Payments account and must accept the
  <a href="https://payments.google.com/payments/apis-secure/get_legal_document?ldo=0&ldt=us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Payments Terms of Service</a>.

</p>

<h3>Subscription Billing</h3>
<p>
  Subscription fees are automatically charged at the start of each billing cycle (weekly, monthly, yearly, or as specified) and may be processed up to 24 hours before the next cycle begins.
</p>

<h3>Trial Periods</h3>
<p>
  You may be offered free trial access to subscription benefits for a specified time. Once the trial period ends, you will be charged unless you cancel before it expires. Cancelling a trial will immediately end your access unless otherwise stated. Free trials may be limited to a certain number per user within a given period.
</p>

<h3>Cancellations</h3>
<p>
  You have the option to cancel your subscription at any time before the current billing cycle concludes. The cancellation will be effective starting with the next billing period. Refunds are not issued for the ongoing cycle unless allowed under
  <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2479637" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play’s Refund Policy</a>
  (for example, in cases of faulty or unusable content).

<h3>Reduced Rates for Print Subscribers</h3>
<p>
  Some content providers may offer reduced digital subscription rates if you already hold a print subscription. If your print subscription ends and is not renewed, your reduced Google Play rate will be automatically cancelled.
</p>

<h3>Price Changes</h3>
<p>
  If a subscription price increases, Google will provide at least 30 days’ notice before charging the higher rate. If you do not agree to the new price, you may cancel before the change takes effect. In some cases, consent may be required for the new rate—failure to provide consent could result in cancellation of your subscription.
