  <p>Thanks a lot for choosing StorySaver: Reels & Videos Downloader. Your support means more than you think.</p>
  
  <p>We made this app because we know how useful it is to save Instagram reels, stories, highlights, photos, and videos directly to your device. Itâ€™s quick, simple, and saves you the trouble of digging through posts later.
</p>
  
  <p>That said, downloading content comes with a bit of responsibility. Everything you save still belongs to the person who created it, and their rights matter.</p>
  
  <p>Important to note: Weâ€™re not linked to Instagram or its parent company in any way. StorySaver: Reels & Videos Downloader is a completely independent project.</p>

  <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
  <p>This app is not sponsored, endorsed, or connected to Instagram in any way.</p>

<p>All the reels, stories, highlights, photos, and videos you download remain the property of their original owners. We respect those rights completely, and we encourage you to always get permission before reusing or sharing content.</p>

<p>If you decide to repost or share something, give proper credit to the creator. If you choose to use their work without permission, thatâ€™s your decision â€” but the responsibility is yours as well.
</p>

<p>We donâ€™t control the content you find on Instagram, and we canâ€™t take responsibility for what happens with the material you download. Whether you save, share, or re-upload something, itâ€™s up to you to make sure youâ€™re not breaking any rules or laws.
</p>

  <h3>Downloading Guidelines & Data Privacy</h3>
  <p>With this app, you can save Instagram reels, stories, highlights, photos, and videos â€” even from private accounts you already have permission to view. Hereâ€™s how it works and how we handle your data:</p>

  <h3>Secure Login Process</h3>
  <p>You log in through a built-in browser inside the app that goes straight to Instagramâ€™s official website.
</p>

<p>We donâ€™t use our own login system, third-party APIs, or anything that touches your account details.

</p>

  <h3>How the App Functions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>The app simply loads Instagramâ€™s actual website inside it.

Your login process works exactly as it would in a normal browser â€” your details go directly to Instagram.

We never copy, alter, or try to fake Instagramâ€™s features.
